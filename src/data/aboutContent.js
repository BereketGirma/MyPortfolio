        `I am passionate about software engineering, mobile app development, and web development. 
        Currently, I am honing my skills through various projects, including full-stack development 
        and backend systems.`,
        
        `I am actively seeking internship opportunities to apply my technical skills and gain 
        hands-on experience in a dynamic, real-world environment. Some of the technologies I've worked with 
        include React, Java, MongoDB, and Unity, and I thrive in collaborative environments where 
        I can both contribute and learn from others.`,
